This repository is for WQD7005 Data Mining Alternative Assessment 1 - Case Study submission.

This case study will need me working with a dataset of customers in e-commerce in groceries and home supplies sector that will expose me to a range of consumer characteristics and past purchases made throughout the past 12 months. I have created a sample dataset based on the structure given that which should represent actual consumer behavior. It consists of 16 columns and 12678 records.

In order for this case study to reach its objective, I use three different tools, which are:

1. Talend Data Integration:
   The well-known open-source data integration and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tool Talend Data Integration makes data collection,
   transformation, and transfer between systems easier. It offers an extensive collection of features and tools for planning,
   implementing, and overseeing data integration procedures.
   
2. Talend Data Preprocessing:
   Talend is an open-source integration tool that offers solutions for preparing data among other data-related tasks. The preparation and
   cleaning of raw data prior to its usage in analytical or machine learning procedures is referred to as data preprocessing. To make the
   process of prepping data easier, Talend provides a variety of tools and components for data integration, transformation, and cleansing.

3. SAS Enterprise Miner:
   The SAS Institute created the software suite SAS Enterprise Miner, which is used for statistical analysis, predictive modeling, and
   data mining. It gives customers a graphical interface so they can create, evaluate, and employ predictive models without knowing how
   to write code. To extract important insights from data, SAS Enterprise Miner is widely used in industries like banking, healthcare,
   marketing, and telecommunications.
