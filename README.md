This repository is for WQD7005 Data Mining Alternative Assessment 1 - Case Study submission.

This case study will need me working with a dataset of customers in e-commerce in groceries and home supplies sector that will expose me to a range of consumer characteristics and past purchases made throughout the past 12 months. I have created a sample dataset based on the structure given that which should represent actual consumer behavior. It consists of 16 columns and 12678 records.

In order for this case study to reach its objective, I use three different tools, which are:

1. Talend Data Integration
2. Talend Data Preprocessing
3. SAS Enterprise Miner
